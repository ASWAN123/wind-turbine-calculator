In this analytic project .
I have  been  working  with  some  data  from wind  turbine  farm in my local  area .
we have this situation ,  turbine may stop for any reason for seconds or  minutes  or even  days .
so we needed to calculate the estimate KWH that should be produced over this stoping time .
* This Excel file contains a 1 month log (up to 5000 row ) of all the times the turbine stopped and the time when it's back to work again .
* knowing that we have a separate file with the average produce KW per second. 
* the average kw per seconds  changed every 10 minute all day long
